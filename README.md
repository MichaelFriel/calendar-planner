# Calendar Planner

## Description

This application can be used as a daily scheduler/planner, which uses colour coding to represent times which are either past, present or future.

The user can input text in each hourly block and then save the text. 

**The functionality is achieved through the following means:**

* Current time is displayed, using Day.js
* HTML elements dynamically injected via jQuery and a for loop.
* Colours of the blocks are updated using a for loop which compares the current time to the ID of the block.
* Content from text blocks is stored in local storage and retrieved when the page is reloaded. This ensures that the content remains until the user updates it and saves the block again.
